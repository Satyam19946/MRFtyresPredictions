# MRFtyresPredictions

This time I have tried to use TensorFlow to train my Model. 
It got me better accuracies than using manual Gradient Descent in MATLAB, thus proving that using in built functions is better and faster. 
The data used is also there in the files.

I am a student who wants to learn machine learning, if any suggestion for books, research papers, or any content, Please Message. 
Any recommendations to improve my code are more than welcome.
